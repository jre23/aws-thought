## Description

The goal for this project was to implement some of the services offered by AWS to an existing app where users are able to post thoughts. The app utilizes a React front-end and a Node.js, Express, and DynamoDB back-end. The app uses an S3 bucket to store pictures, a DynamoDB to store all other data, and is hosted on an EC2 instance.
